## Teaching Style

The Maestro David Aragon uses a variety of teaching styles to improve student learning and retention.

In the lessons the students will be tested on memory recognition, elaboration, topical tasks, personalisation,
role-play, note taking, etc. I provide a multitude of learning materials all from verified instructional associations such as CELTA and ESL practice materials.
